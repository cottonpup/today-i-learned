# How to think like a developer 

Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan. 

1. Make sure you 100% understand a problem.

2. Divide and conquer. 

3. Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to. 

4. For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code.

pseudo code is a code for humans to understand not computers. 사람이 이해할 수 있게 적어놓은 코드.. 자바스크립트 코드도 아니고 인간언어도 아닌..
