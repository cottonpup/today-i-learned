## Don't say foreigner, Say expat

## Don't say America, Say U.S

There's North, Central and South America so to some people from other parts of
those continents, they might be offended if they only hear the U.S. referred to
as "America".

## ‘I’ve been to’ and ‘I’ve been in’?

"I've been in" implies that you are STILL there For example, "I've been in Korea
for five years" it means that I have been staying or living here up until now

"I've been to" is specifically for visits or short stays - It means you aren't
there anymore
